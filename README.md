## Decentralized Social Media Platform with NFTs

Developing a decentralized social media platform using Solidity. The platform allows users to create and share content in the form of NFTs, representing multimedia assets such as images, videos, and audio clips. The platformincorporates advanced features such as user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), content moderation, and gasless transactions.

## Features

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implements an authentication mechanism to verify the identity of users.
   - Users must register and sign in to interact with the platform.

2. **NFT Creation with Factory Contracts:**
   - Utilize factory contracts for NFT creation features.
   - All NFT interactions (minting, etc.) are handled via the social media contract.

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Implements RBAC to manage permissions for different user roles.
   - Define roles such as regular users and administrators.

4. **Access Control:**
   - Ensures that sensitive functions are only accessible to authorized users.
   - Define access control for key platform functionalities.

5. **Group/Community Creation:**
   - Implements the creation of groups/communities on the platform.
   - Users can create and join different groups with shared interests.

6. **Content Discovery and Interaction:**
   - Allow users to discover content through searching and browsing.
   - Implement features for commenting on NFTs and engaging with the community.

7. **Gasless Transactions:**
   - Implement a gasless transaction mechanism.
   - Users should not pay for gas while using the platform.

8. **Testnet Deployment and Contract Verification:**
   - Deployed to sepolia testnet.
   - verified on sepolia testnet.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Develop all features using Solidity; no DApp is required for this task.
- Follow best practices for smart contract development.
- Thoroughly test your smart contract to ensure functionality and security.
- Clearly document your code, explaining the purpose of each function and its parameters.
